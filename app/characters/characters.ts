She did that once - on accident - and she has not been able to replicate it since. Anyway, now she has gills - and you most likely don't. So do not mess with her near water. And do not mess with anything she loves anywhere near a plant, or she will find a one-time way to ward you with it. She does not know what or how she will do, but she promises that she will figure it out, and that it will be very, very uncomfortable. For you. The Giggle at Your Funeral will love it.",

The nearly-nihilistic preacher takes a puff of a cigar as he leans back in his chair. The teacher sips from a half-empty bottle to stave off despair.',
			'Beneath this scene swirls a layered stew of dreams. A self-automating Alchemist exchanges energy for money in the name of transmuting a better future for his little homunculus. A child dreams of brighter days following a trying ordeal. A mother holds her baby.',
			"The Twig Sentinel - Bearing a bark shield, she is a walking hug with a drive to defend. She fears the roaring of thunder, because it reminds her of all the times she had to bark to keep her home safe - she hopes she never has to bite. Seriously. Could you please quiet down? You're stressing her out.",
