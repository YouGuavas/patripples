					As with the concept, this is a living document. I am working on it as
					I go along. You are welcome to come back to check for updates whenever
					it pleases you.

				<p className={`paragraph full left`}>
					Have you ever tossed a handful of pebbles into a pond or a creek, and
					watched the water ripple?
				</p>{' '}
				<p className={`paragraph full left`}>
					If you have, you have changed the course of history - etched your
					fingerprint onto the world in a lasting way. How did you do that?
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph full left`}>
					You did that through curiosity, or through resilience, or through
					intuition. You did that because something within you compelled you to.
					If you did something like this recently, then probably, you were
					pondering how imbalanced things are. In a previous decade, maybe you
					did so because you wanted to see what would happen, or because you
					realized that you&apos;d never reach Mars, so you invented a clever,
					impish way to move it a stone&apos;s throw and a skip away.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph full left`}>
					Scientifically speaking, you did that through the long, slow process
					of erosion.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph full left`}>
					Those pebbles you tossed - however small - altered the flow of the
					water and the air around them. They did this in their removal; in
					their displacement. Consider both the spaces that they left behind,
					and the spaces we now occupy.
				</p>

					How to throw stones.
				</h2>
				<p className={`paragraph full left`}>
					Every action we take creates a vibration around us. You know this if
					you have ever jumped into the air, and listened to the sound that your
					feet made as they returned to the Earth.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph full left`}>
					Actions above some threshold of density and impact velocity create
					sounds. Most know this, in their way. This is nothing new to you.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph full left`}>
					I recently sat and considered the rippling of my own impact. I saw it
					in the way that a family of deer ran from me when I coughed in the
					forest. Do you know who flinches when you sneeze? Your victim.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph full left`}>
					I do not want fish to fear me. That is not the kind of blessing I want
					for me.

						Amplifying Nature - Healing old wounds. Let what would otherwise

						Accelerating Empathy - Deep empathy - for each other, of course;
						also for all living beings, and for the planet on which we all
						reside - improves outcomes for everyone. The mathematics of this
						checks out. It will prove itself. Or you can look up mid-term and
						long-term financial outcomes in societies who historically have
						prized health and ecological harmony vs those who have prioritized
						industry.
