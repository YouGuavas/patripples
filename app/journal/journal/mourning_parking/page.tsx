				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					&quot;Woo!&quot; she cheered, elfishly, into her mirror.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					She&apos;d finally done it! In her fifteen years of gleeful glazing at
					the grocery, she&apos;d often arrived early.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					But she&apos;d never been there before four, before.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					This morning was made for her!{' '}
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					She was going to make so many donuts. She was going to get out early
					on this perfect Saturday. Even if her kids were too busy to visit
					again, she was going to have energy for Pepper, the petite pupper, and
					she was going to read a bit of her new book.
				</p>

				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					She&apos;d gotten a good night&apos;s rest, and even woke for her
					alarm on the scecond try - another personal best! On top of all of
					that, today&aspos;s weather was going to be flawless! She was
					ecstatic!
				</p>
				<hr />
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					&quot;Goddamn it!&quot; shouted her equally-early coworker, less
					enthused.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					&quot;What&apos;s the matter?&quot; she asked, her voice carrying
					slightly less of that charming chime she was known for.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					&quot;Boss gave me the key, but no code. We can&apos;t get in!&quot;
					he replied as he jangled toward his truck.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					&quot;Oh, my! That&apos;s no good!&quot; she chirped. &quot;Can you
					call someone?&quot;
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					&quot;It&apos;s no use. Aside from Boss, Joss and Ross are the only
					ones who know the code. Boss took Saturday off, Ross has been MIA for
					weeks, and Joss refuses work contact outside her shift. She&apos;s not
					in until six. You&apos;ve been here fifteen years, you know it&apos;s
					always like this. I&apos;m going to get some sleep. You&apos;d do well
					to do the same.&quot;
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					&quot;Oh, that&apos;s okay... I think I&apos;ll sta-&quot;
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					Her coworker starts his truck and pulls away.{' '}
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					&quot;-just in case.&quot; and she turns and walks back to her truck,
					head hanging.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					He had been right. She wasn&apos;t young. She had been through it.
					Seen how things were. She wasn&apos;t dumb, either - just courageously
					kind, if only through spite. She knew that this wasn&apos;t her
					forever home, and had never intended to be here this long.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					But she hadn&apos;t only seen herself and others around her trading
					their freedom and their dreams for survival and other men&apos;s
					schemes. She had seen far too many could-have-been-good days soured
					like spoiled milk following small spills. She had also learned to see
					a little light peeping at the edges of this seemingly endless
					in-between.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					Somehow, she had managed to find hope in that hometown grocery
					community.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					And here came her other coworker, anyway. Surely, she would save the
					day. The Elf waved as she hopped down out of her truck and walked up
					to the green Chevy Cruze that had pulled into the lot nearby.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					The driver rolled down the window.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					Ahh! A man. Is he ho-
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					&quot;-I&apos;m a wanderer. Well, I&apos;m from here, but I&apos;m in
					a wandering phase. I&apos;m not sleeping here or anything.&quot; he
					presciently over-explained.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					&quot;Oh, I- I don&apos;t care about that. I thought you were my
					coworker.&quot;{' '}
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					The wanderer smiled softly, and The Elf continued, loosely explaining
					what had just unfurled.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					Following a brief conversation about the unfairness of her
					predicament, the wanderer gave The Elf such a kind compliment about
					her energy that, although she could no longer recall his words, she
					did remember feeling validated and seen in her defiant kindness all
					day.

					Intro.
				</h3>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					In this damn near rudderless world, we often find ourselves beholden
					to certain overarching currents which envelop us.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					To begin, let us ask ourselves some questions, and do our best to hold
					these with us as we continue:
				</p>
				<ul
					className={`flex column gap-medium pad-none width-half left-align px-1`}
				>
					<li>What can we learn about freedom and traditional work?</li>{' '}
					<li>What thoughts does this trigger regarding resilience?</li>{' '}
					<li>Where did The Elf&apos;s unpaid efforts go?</li>{' '}
					<li>
						What sort of emotional journey did The Elf endure, and what will be
						the effect of that on the rest of her week?
					</li>{' '}
					<li>
						What sort of person tends to find themself in positions like this?
						Do you see any parallels in your life?
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					Upon dissection of The Elf&apos;s vignette, I am able to observe, at
					once - within both our key-clanking Goblin and our sugar sweet Elf -
					past and future fragments of a fractured, mirrored self. What about
					you?
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					What do you see when you dig real deep?
				</p>
				<h3
					className={`lowercase style-1 thin spaced left width-full block left-align`}
				>
					Resilience and Freedom.
				</h3>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					A friend of mine recently expressed, in her way, resentment at having
					received so many compliments on her resilience. She also expressed
					that this resentment stems from her possession of two deeply human
					desires:
				</p>
				<ul
					className={`flex column gap-medium pad-none width-half left-align px-1`}
				>
					<li>One for connection</li>
					<li>The other for comfort</li>
				</ul>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					It was her position that all these compliments on her resilience had
					felt more like comments on her ability to take a hit when the only
					contact she&apos;d wanted to take was something like a hug, at best.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					I can&apos;t blame her for holding her position. It seems to me a
					common enough sentiment. We all wish for peace and comfort from time
					to time. It is a normal and natural thing to do, in this chaotic
					planet of constant static. Human beings and elfs alike are most able
					to express our best selves when our nervous systems are operating
					within a bandwidth of stability and relative calm. That much is
					certain.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					What is less clear is how we can arrive at that stable bandwidth when
					this turbulent world bats us back and forth like a small ship in a sea
					storm that was somehow designed by a cat.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					We can and we should wish for a gentler world. Aiming for peace is the
					only way for us to achieve it, after all, and there is no reason why
					this world shouldn&apos;t be a kinder place than it is. We humans are
					Earth&apos;s Game Masters. Collective survival is a non-zero-sum game
					in a world of abundance. That is, when there is enough to go around,
					everyone can win.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					Now, flip that coin.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					Our current world isn&apos;t kinder, and isn&apos;t gentler than it
					is. Yet, still, we must live here. Previous generations of
					Earth&apos;s Game Masters, doing the best they could with what they
					had at the time, misunderstood survival as a zero-sum game (there must
					be a winner AND a loser, with the loser fully losing and the winner
					fully winning). In a world of scarcity, it often is. Or seems so.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					This tells me that until a strong majority of our species can heal its
					collective survival wounds, things will continue on in turbulence. How
					do we prepare ourselves for that? How do survive this continued
					reality?
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					In a world of scarcity, resilience is worth galaxies more than gold.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					Resilience - which constantly buys us additional attempts at
					surviving, winning, and thriving - is the life raft which will float
					us home after our wishes have washed themselves down Earth&apos;s
					River of Chaos. The Elf carried her resilience much in the same way as
					so many others do today: quietly, her smile a dam holding back tears.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					The Elf deserves her freedom. She put forth effort, she hustled, and
					still, for no fault of her own, she saw no reward. That isn&apos;t
					right. Her resilience surely carried her through the remainder of her
					Lost Saturday. She no doubt showed up to work smiling the next day -
					if at 6 AM instead of 4.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					She will never complain. I will do so for her.

					closing thoughts.
				</h3>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					Similar stories abound in workplaces all around.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					How many would-be da Vincis, Einsteins, Hypatias of Alexandria, and
					Julia Childs in the making are out their pouring their souls instead
					into spaces where their bossess won&apos;t honor their waiting?
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					What do you suppose The Elf baked when she made it home?
