				Whenever I enter a new space, I aim to gain a sense for its gravity.
				This is particularly true when I see signs of a high-agency resident -
				such as an eagle or an owl, or a silent entity which breathes through
				the trees, or on the other side of a lens - I engage in a set of
				universal reverence and deference maneuvers. I bow, and I show my empty,
				upturned palms. I bare my neck, and expose my vein. I whistle to
				announce my presence. Just in case there is some eagle or owl - or
				something else - standing sentry over that space.
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				I engage in these reverence maneuvers because I hope to invite
				curiosity, where fear has long festered. This ritual seems to work best
				when performed with sincerity, so I bow and then whistle in your
				direction.

				Yesterday, I searched the woods around me for non-biodegradable trash
				and possible stagnant swamps left behind by improper waste disposal -
				which I suspected was there because there have been cyclically
				increasing wind events <em>and</em> mosquito blooms nearby; suspicious
				underground gas activities; interesting mycelial adaptations surrounding
				other local ponds; alterations in groundwater acidity levels dating back
				half a decade; altered bird pathways over the last decade - all in an
				area which would have been primed for illicit dumping and for leaving
				waste behind to decay in place at a time when pollution was already
				commonplace. Five years ago, a former partner and I were approached by
				an older gentleman while out for a hike. He offered us his concerns
				about the local cattail population, so I held onto that as a mental
				note. Muskrats and geese both rely on cattails. Recently, I have seen
				fewer geese in local waters than in years past, and those who have been
				here have positioned themselves in hiding due to habitat encroachments.
				Most notably - in alliance with the muskrats, <em>upstream</em> of the
				cattails. I have also noticed increased muskrat sensitivity to my
				presence during this span. This supports the idea that those cattails
				have suffered cyclical losses over the last five years, relating to
				groundwater ph changes and cyclically increasing wind events nearby. In
				turn, the geese and muskrats have moved out of these once habitable
				cattails, and into more human-intersecting domains (roadways, backyard
				ponds, and <em>shudders</em> golf courses). Where geese and muskrats
				once splashed about, cormorants now sit. Where cormorants sit, they
				defecate. Cormorants can thrive in acidic waters, and their waste itself
				is acidic. Can you see the cycle forming? I recently read an article
				about raccoons having been used in the past to hassle cormorants&apos;
				nests enough that the birds leave for clearer waters. I know of a few
				local pest raccoon and opossum populations, as well as a pinched bird
				network. It is my belief that my current restoration effort, plus some
				reconsideration of local construction and ecosystem management habits,
				will help this ecosystem to restore itself <em>before</em> it collapses
				entirely. And I definitely did not just follow crows out there and then
				connect the dots later. Totally knew what I was doing.

				The next time you&apos;re in a natural space, take a look around. You
				don&apos;t have to untangle an entire microsystem - picking up one piece
				of litter without destroying the nature around it creates a ripple which
				strengthens everyone on Earth&apos;s compounded interests over time. You
				don&apos;t have to lift a finger, just some litter.

			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				As I approached the swamp, I felt oppressed by the weight of its
				atmosphere. I wondered why the crows had pulled me there. I could not
				drain this space. I could not lift these weights.
			</p>

			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				However I came to be there, I did arrive. I found my swamp. I observed
				severe damage all around - it reminded me of a wound, left to fester;
				hidden instead of healed. I took actions to encourage natural water
				flow, in alignment with what was there - accounting for chaotic
				displacement over time resulting from human-left scraps. I recruited
				nature&apos;s filtration systems in using logs and biological matter, in
				tandem with a local set of mycelial networks which seem to be slowly
				adapting toward efficient decomposition of heavy metals and polymers. I
				removed several broken shards of long-discarded piping from the ground,
				alleviating gas and groundwater venting pathways - and also improving
				worm efficiency. This increases calcium cycling (which I intend to
				augment in an ecologically-friendly way via crushed eggshells). I set up
				a rain eroder for a cluster of metal scraps - arranged within a drainage
				tube which is set at a tilt, constructed to use a protruding log to soak
				up some rainwater, filter it downward and over some limestone chunks,
				and then through a flow-friendly central channel - composed of sticks
				and iron scraps - before reaching the bottom of the drainage tube and
				rerouting itself away from the nearby tree&apos;s root system (which is
				struggling to unnatural erosion), and instead as a stream in alignment
				with natural erosions, down into the pond over time. I braced trees with
				limestone, tires and barrels, and then reoriented some uphill biological
				matter downhill, in accordance with the idea that some of that was
				likely only positioned where it was due to chaotic conditions caused by
				this festering wound, and its resultant recycling backup. I did this
				with the design to naturally bolster nearby trees&apos; root systems and
				combat erosion. I constructed swamp straws by laying dry logs which did
				not appear to be critical to some nearby mycelial network, trunk-side
				down, in the swamp, and perpendicular to logs or tires or things which
				were already there, and which could either stand to erode faster
				themselves (the metals and tires), or which were not threats to
				accelerate erosion (the logs). Over time, this should nudge the scales
				in nature&apos;s favor. Today, I saw a robin pecking around the
				perimeter in search of worms. It still seemed averse to the water. I
				took this to be a sign - that a series of small actions, repeated over
				time, can ripple outward and compound upward in fascinating ways.

				We are all ostensibly intelligent primates bound to a filthy magma
				marble somewhere in the middle of a cosmic fidget spinner. I am frequent
				to lose focus and drift off into apparently disjointed mental tangents
				and rabbit holes, which I refer to as &apos;side quests.&apos; Our cars
				are powered by dinosaurs; we may be being collectively vibe checked by
				crows and dolphins; a contained chaos engine built on shifting bedrock,
				and the ghosts of Florida Men past negotiate the precarious balance of
				our world&apos;s weather systems. None of that has to make sense. You
				just have to respect that it is how it is.

				None of us are Elon Musk rich, but most of us have the power to help the
				muskrats. And a lot of stuff happens downstream of muskrats. Like, way
				more stuff than happens downstream of Elon Musk. Or any other
				influential person. If nature were the US, a muskrat would have
				something like well-integrated, lower middle-class second-generation
				white immigrant status, and humans would be treated the way that we are
				treating current immigrants. Even the chipmunks were giving us side eye.

				The crows seem to be using me as an unpaid cleaning service - not for
				themselves, but for our past selves. In exchange for my cooperation,
				they are repaying me with natural foresight - learned wisdom obtained
				through nature&apos;s having observed the rise and fall of{' '}
				<em>every</em> dynasty - and omens in the form of cans. Ecological
				symbiosis is a well-documented phenomenon. Species work together in

				Today, one of my crows helped me to see over a bridge, dancing in a
				small, rolling vortex of wind, which gently tumbled to my southwest.
				This could be interpreted as a sign that warm air had been displaced
				upward to my northeast, replaced by cool, reflective vapors long trapped
				beneath industrial left-behind lands. As this crow danced in the wind,
				they also timed their spiral, in strangely coincidental alignment with
				the time at which I could begin crossing the road safe from traffic.

				Carl Sagan, in his day, worried about nuclear weapons - the emerging
				threat of his time - and he was right to, considering how we have
				behaved since and long before then. The emerging threats of our time
				seem, to me, to be something like these:
			</p>
			<ul
				className={`width-full block left-align no-deco flex column gap-medium`}
			>
				<li>
					Shortcutting - the all-too understandable desire to take the most
					direct route to some solution.
				</li>
				<li>
					Compounding - the echo understood by everyone who has taken Econ 101.
					All actions create a ripple; over time, by way of distribution and
					aggregation effects, these ripples develop a sort of
					&quot;gravity,&quot; magnetically pooling other ripples and resources
					together.
				</li>
				<li>
					Overlooking - we were all so brain-fogged and bogged down for so long
					(and continue to be) that, between the government and the masses, a
					lot of things slipped through the cracks for a long time in a row.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				Here, I will outline how these ideas show up in nature as a result of
				past ripples. I intend to dig into this with more depth later. For now,
				consider a leaf. The leaf floats along the surface of a creek. As it
				floats, it runs an ever-increasing chance of encountering a log,
				becoming lodged, and functioning as part of a brilliantly-efficient,
				natural, nutrient-leaching, biodegradation process. This is wonderful.
				Until a plastic bag floats along and becomes lodged. Now, I hope that
				most of us today know how harmful it is to litter. But consider how many
				long-forgotten plastic bags sit hidden in overlooked spaces - and how
				many anoxic ponds sit bubbling like blisters, warded from animals for
				decades by thorns for their danger - trapping moisture and allowing
				mosquitoes and bacteria to breed in cyclically increasing blooms.
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				Can you begin to see the interconnectedness of these three ideas? Can
				you see how overlooking shortcutting leads to compounding ailments? The
				end is not nigh. Still, if we don&apos;t find some way to protect our
				neighbors against it, it might just sneak up on the whole network.

				Whales are spitting people out of the ocean. Wind events are ramping up.
				Does it seem to you as though our world is becoming increasingly
				chaotic, increasingly entropic, increasingly-
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>-ominous?</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				If you want to do something about it, you have the ability. Begin by
				reminding yourself that you are conscious and sovereign, and that as you
				embody a healing example and do what you can to help the world around
				you to get better, and allow yourself to be seen doing it, your
				sovereign echo ripples ever outward into the very substrate of
				consciousness. Earth is trying to sort out her sickness. There are
				actions being taken every day which accelerate her sickness and ours.
				Each small act of non-destructive healing - done onto the Earth herself,
				or onto any animals or ethically-acting people around you - helps to
				shift nature&apos;s weights in counterbalance to this. Earth
				doesn&apos;t need a savior, but it does need a bunch of people
				hyper-focused on untangling knots. The more consistent and patient the
				effort, the clearer the path which presents itself. I like this place. I
				like crows. They tolerate us. Tenuously. We&apos;re walking a thin line.
				Let&apos;s start passing a few tests. Nature might do some of the rest.
