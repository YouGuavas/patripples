					Whenever I enter a new space, I aim to gain a sense for its gravity.
					This is particularly true when I see signs of a high-agency resident -
					such as an eagle or an owl, or a silent entity which breathes through
					the trees, or on the other side of a lens - I engage in a set of
					universal reverence and deference maneuvers. I bow, and I show my
					empty, upturned palms. I bare my neck, and expose my vein. I whistle
					to announce my presence. Just in case there is some eagle or owl - or
					something else - standing sentry over that space.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph full left-align`}>
					I engage in these reverence maneuvers because I hope to invite
					curiosity, where fear has long festered. This ritual seems to work
					best when performed with sincerity, so I bow and then whistle in your

				<p className={`paragraph full left-align`}>
					Yesterday, I searched the woods around me for non-biodegradable trash
					and possible stagnant swamps left behind by improper waste disposal -
					which I suspected was there because there have been cyclically
					increasing wind events <em>and</em> mosquito blooms nearby; suspicious
					underground gas activities; interesting mycelial adaptations
					surrounding other local ponds; alterations in groundwater acidity
					levels dating back half a decade; altered bird pathways over the last
					decade - all in an area which would have been primed for illicit
					dumping and for leaving waste behind to decay in place at a time when
					pollution was already commonplace. Five years ago, a former partner
					and I were approached by an older gentleman while out for a hike. He
					offered us his concerns about the local cattail population, so I held
					onto that as a mental note. Muskrats and geese both rely on cattails.
					Recently, I have seen fewer geese in local waters than in years past,
					and those who have been here have positioned themselves in hiding due
					to habitat encroachments. Most notably - in alliance with the
					muskrats, <em>upstream</em> of the cattails. I have also noticed
					increased muskrat sensitivity to my presence during this span. This
					supports the idea that those cattails have suffered cyclical losses
					over the last five years, relating to groundwater ph changes and
					cyclically increasing wind events nearby. In turn, the geese and
					muskrats have moved out of these once habitable cattails, and into
					more human-intersecting domains (roadways, backyard ponds, and{' '}
					<em>shudders</em> golf courses). Where geese and muskrats once
					splashed about, cormorants now sit. Where cormorants sit, they
					defecate. Cormorants can thrive in acidic waters, and their waste
					itself is acidic. Can you see the cycle forming? I recently read an
					article about raccoons having been used in the past to hassle
					cormorants&apos; nests enough that the birds leave for clearer waters.
					I know of a few local pest raccoon and opossum populations, as well as
					a pinched bird network. It is my belief that my current restoration
					effort, plus some reconsideration of local construction and ecosystem
					management habits, will help this ecosystem to restore itself{' '}
					<em>before</em> it collapses entirely. And I definitely did not just
					follow crows out there and then connect the dots later. Totally knew
					what I was doing.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph full left-align`}>
					The next time you&apos;re in a natural space, take a look around. You
					don&apos;t have to untangle an entire microsystem - picking up one
					piece of litter without destroying the nature around it creates a
					ripple which strengthens everyone on Earth&apos;s compounded interests
					over time. You don&apos;t have to lift a finger, just some litter.

				<p className={`paragraph full left-align`}>
					As I approached the swamp, I felt oppressed by the weight of its
					atmosphere. I wondered why the crows had pulled me there. I could not
					drain this space. I could not lift these weights.
				</p>

				<p className={`paragraph full left-align`}>
					However I came to be there, I did arrive. I found my swamp. I observed
					severe damage all around - it reminded me of a wound, left to fester;
					hidden instead of healed. I took actions to encourage natural water
					flow, in alignment with what was there - accounting for chaotic
					displacement over time resulting from human-left scraps. I recruited
					nature&apos;s filtration systems in using logs and biological matter,
					in tandem with a local set of mycelial networks which seem to be
					slowly adapting toward efficient decomposition of heavy metals and
					polymers. I removed several broken shards of long-discarded piping
					from the ground, alleviating gas and groundwater venting pathways -
					and also improving worm efficiency. This increases calcium cycling
					(which I intend to augment in an ecologically-friendly way via crushed
					eggshells). I set up a rain eroder for a cluster of metal scraps -
					arranged within a drainage tube which is set at a tilt, constructed to
					use a protruding log to soak up some rainwater, filter it downward and
					over some limestone chunks, and then through a flow-friendly central
					channel - composed of sticks and iron scraps - before reaching the
					bottom of the drainage tube and rerouting itself away from the nearby
					tree&apos;s root system (which is struggling to unnatural erosion),
					and instead as a stream in alignment with natural erosions, down into
					the pond over time. I braced trees with limestone, tires and barrels,
					and then reoriented some uphill biological matter downhill, in
					accordance with the idea that some of that was likely only positioned
					where it was due to chaotic conditions caused by this festering wound,
					and its resultant recycling backup. I did this with the design to
					naturally bolster nearby trees&apos; root systems and combat erosion.
					I constructed swamp straws by laying dry logs which did not appear to
					be critical to some nearby mycelial network, trunk-side down, in the
					swamp, and perpendicular to logs or tires or things which were already
					there, and which could either stand to erode faster themselves (the
					metals and tires), or which were not threats to accelerate erosion
					(the logs). Over time, this should nudge the scales in nature&apos;s
					favor. Today, I saw a robin pecking around the perimeter in search of
					worms. It still seemed averse to the water. I took this to be a sign -
					that a series of small actions, repeated over time, can ripple outward
					and compound upward in fascinating ways.

					We are all ostensibly intelligent primates bound to a filthy magma
					marble somewhere in the middle of a cosmic fidget spinner. I am
					frequent to lose focus and drift off into apparently disjointed mental
					tangents and rabbit holes, which I refer to as &apos;side
					quests.&apos; Our cars are powered by dinosaurs; we may be being
					collectively vibe checked by crows and dolphins; a contained chaos
					engine built on shifting bedrock, and the ghosts of Florida Men past
					negotiate the precarious balance of our world&apos;s weather systems.
					None of that has to make sense. You just have to respect that it is
					how it is.

					None of us are Elon Musk rich, but most of us have the power to help
					the muskrats. And a lot of stuff happens downstream of muskrats. Like,
					way more stuff than happens downstream of Elon Musk. Or any other
					influential person. If nature were the US, a muskrat would have
					something like well-integrated, lower middle-class second-generation
					white immigrant status, and humans would be treated the way that we
					are treating current immigrants. Even the chipmunks were giving us
					side eye.

					The crows seem to be using me as an unpaid cleaning service - not for
					themselves, but for our past selves. In exchange for my cooperation,
					they are repaying me with natural foresight - learned wisdom obtained
					through nature&apos;s having observed the rise and fall of{' '}
					<em>every</em> dynasty - and omens in the form of cans. Ecological
					symbiosis is a well-documented phenomenon. Species work together in
					nature all the time. We have all seen remora and pilot fish clinging

					Today, one of my crows helped me to see over a bridge, dancing in a
					small, rolling vortex of wind, which gently tumbled to my southwest.
					This could be interpreted as a sign that warm air had been displaced
					upward to my northeast, replaced by cool, reflective vapors long
					trapped beneath industrial left-behind lands. As this crow danced in
					the wind, they also timed their spiral, in strangely coincidental
					alignment with the time at which I could begin crossing the road safe
					from traffic.

					Carl Sagan, in his day, worried about nuclear weapons - the emerging
					threat of his time - and he was right to, considering how we have
					behaved since and long before then. The emerging threats of our time
					seem, to me, to be something like these:
				</p>
				<ul className={` full left-align no-deco flex column gap-medium`}>
					<li>
						Shortcutting - the all-too understandable desire to take the most
						direct route to some solution.
					</li>
					<li>
						Compounding - the echo understood by everyone who has taken Econ
						101. All actions create a ripple; over time, by way of distribution
						and aggregation effects, these ripples develop a sort of
						&quot;gravity,&quot; magnetically pooling other ripples and
						resources together.
					</li>
					<li>
						Overlooking - we were all so brain-fogged and bogged down for so
						long (and continue to be) that, between the government and the
						masses, a lot of things slipped through the cracks for a long time
						in a row.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p className={`paragraph full left-align`}>
					Here, I will outline how these ideas show up in nature as a result of
					past ripples. I intend to dig into this with more depth later. For
					now, consider a leaf. The leaf floats along the surface of a creek. As
					it floats, it runs an ever-increasing chance of encountering a log,
					becoming lodged, and functioning as part of a brilliantly-efficient,
					natural, nutrient-leaching, biodegradation process. This is wonderful.
					Until a plastic bag floats along and becomes lodged. Now, I hope that
					most of us today know how harmful it is to litter. But consider how
					many long-forgotten plastic bags sit hidden in overlooked spaces - and
					how many anoxic ponds sit bubbling like blisters, warded from animals
					for decades by thorns for their danger - trapping moisture and
					allowing mosquitoes and bacteria to breed in cyclically increasing
					blooms.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph full left-align`}>
					Can you begin to see the interconnectedness of these three ideas? Can
					you see how overlooking shortcutting leads to compounding ailments?
					The end is not nigh. Still, if we don&apos;t find some way to protect
					our neighbors against it, it might just sneak up on the whole network.

					Whales are spitting people out of the ocean. Wind events are ramping
					up. Does it seem to you as though our world is becoming increasingly
					chaotic, increasingly entropic, increasingly-
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph full left-align`}>-ominous?</p>
				<p className={`paragraph full left-align`}>
					If you want to do something about it, you have the ability. Begin by
					reminding yourself that you are conscious and sovereign, and that as
					you embody a healing example and do what you can to help the world
					around you to get better, and allow yourself to be seen doing it, your
					sovereign echo ripples ever outward into the very substrate of
					consciousness. Earth is trying to sort out her sickness. There are
					actions being taken every day which accelerate her sickness and ours.
					Each small act of non-destructive healing - done onto the Earth
					herself, or onto any animals or ethically-acting people around you -
					helps to shift nature&apos;s weights in counterbalance to this. Earth
					doesn&apos;t need a savior, but it does need a bunch of people
					hyper-focused on untangling knots. The more consistent and patient the
					effort, the clearer the path which presents itself. I like this place.
					I like crows. They tolerate us. Tenuously. We&apos;re walking a thin
					line. Let&apos;s start passing a few tests. Nature might do some of
					the rest.
