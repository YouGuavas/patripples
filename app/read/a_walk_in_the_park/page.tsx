					How to sit down on a log.
				</h2>
				<p className={`paragraph full left-align`}>
					Today, I saw three birds in a tree.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph full left-align`}>
					Long before, they saw me perch myself upon a fallen log and puff up my
					breast with strange breaths. Some were long - First, I filled a green
					log&apos;s lungs with deep, seated trees&apos; breaths. Then I took
					some short and some long, as I bellowed up my belly with Tummo&apos;s
					fiercest heat breaths. Third, I called aloud and two crows cawed
					loudly back to me.
				</p>

				<p className={`paragraph full left-align`}>
					They perched upon a dead tree - stood tall before me. Two crows, four
					eyes, each one leaving me seen. I set beside me one blue bead as they,
					too, observed me, sat down on their living room moss seat. I closed my
					eyes, and I resumed my breathing. When I reopened my two beads, I
					could see no eyes seeing me.

				</h2>
				<p className={`paragraph full left-align`}>So I began to walk.</p>
				<p className={`paragraph full left-align`}>
					I did this just as I always do: by standing up fast, whistling two low
					blasts, and grabbing a fist full of trash. And just as I&apos;d stood,
					I began walking too fast, and my head full of air, I detected no
					stare. Yet silently there, who barred my way with two hidden eyes in
					full glare? One bird in the brush - half as wide as in the wing and
					twice as startled by me as I was by he. He leapt into flight, which
					gave me a fright - until a limb&apos;s reprieve he received. Upon it,
					relieved, a Barred Owl - perched and perceived.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph full left-align`}>What did they see?</p>
				<p className={`paragraph full left-align`}>
					Unburdened were we, when - our tension relieved - we were interceived
					by those two crows whose beads we&apos;d last seen when I sat myself
					down on their green, mossy seat.
				</p>
				<Image

				<p className={`paragraph full left-align`}>
					&quot;CAW! CAW! CAW!&quot; From out of frame, they came and they
					perched and began to commune. Above me conceived, and so I received -
					as above, so below - I believed these two birds had conceived of
					standing upon a branch of sprawling peace.

					How to break an olive branch.
				</h2>
				<p className={`paragraph full left-align`}>
					Let&apos;s focus on me for a moment.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph full left-align`}>
					A tension-filled peace sits uneasy between three branching birds who
					have long deceived; how tension mounts when another crosses this line
					of attention.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph full left-align`}>
					Upon receiving permission via psychic transmission - three tense
					birds&apos; percussive silence - our faithful observer pulled out a
					blue jeaned back pocket galaxy&apos;s black lens and began to record
					the dance of <em>our</em> triumvirate mirrors.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph full left-align`}>
					Immune to mistakes, I correctly interpreted every cue from these two,
					and boldly inched closer to this budding truce. Silently I crept, like
					a mouse through a house - all six-foot-three and two-hundred pounds -
					without making a sound as I redefined &quot;stealth.&quot; Or would
					have, but for each twig which broke itself beneath my catlike agility.
					Or those noisy leaves who&apos;d set out to shout at each silent step.

					how to betray an owl.
				</h2>
				<p className={`paragraph full left-align`}>Back to the birds.</p>
				<p className={`paragraph full left-align`}>
					These crows, it seems, had not communed, but conspired. I can&apos;t
					say when, but ahead of the scene, these untruceful two had come up
					with a scheme: while knowing the stakes, they&apos;d accept any slight
					as a great mistake - a flinch, a quiver, a shake - is all it would
					take, and both these old crows would peck like spring hens.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph full left-align`}>
					Unseeded now our olive branch, left instead: a long-lashing
					willow&apos;s switch. Our uneasy three reached a tenuous truce atop a
					teetering tree. Completely un-influenced by my brilliant reframing of
					the concept of stealth: all it took was a flinch, in the end. Whose?
					Yes.

				<p className={`paragraph full left-align`}>
					What would you do if your flock cawed on you?
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph full left-align`}>
					Face to face at last with their bar-necked nemesis, these corvid
					conspirators could not help but to help themselves. Each infinite one
					of this alchemical three being implicitly aware of the stakes of the
					equivalent exchange which came before them, our dinosaurs&apos;
					detente transformed into a powder keg. Again, with no influence from
					my unbridled stealth.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph full left-align`}>
					At the last left shout of a loud-mouthed leaf beneath my silent right
					foot, who flinched? The owl. Which barred him for life.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph full left-align`}>
					Two crows take flight - they strike and they strike, and who flees?
					Our now-barred owl. His crime? He flinched. And maybe raided a few
					nests. Like <em>way</em> back in the day. Or, like, last night. Owls
					have not yet codified their tracking of time. But that hardly matters.
					He had only raided their nest because they refused to quit
					&quot;CAW&quot;ing in the middle of the day. Plus, they kept eating
					the mice he&apos;d left out as offerings to his girlfriend, the moon.
					Can you believe them?

					how to look at birds.
				</h2>
				<p className={`paragraph full left-align`}>
					If we take this natural interaction as a metaphor for uneasy
					ceasefires and ancient betrayals the world over, over all time, then
					it is easy to arrive at some sort of nihilistic view - that no real
					peace can last in this world; that too much intergenerational damage
					has been done for deep trust and collaboration to take root. And maybe
					that is a long way off, but consider the owl who fled.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph full left-align`}>
					That owl could have fought and died instead. In taking strategic
					flight, he set us up for a thought experiment - a spooky
					superposition: since all three birds survived this encounter, all
					three birds get to try again, which means that a number of potential
					outcomes continue to exist. Could you glimpse peace - only for a
					moment; right on the future&apos;s cusp, as a shimmer just beyond the
					horizon - beginning to coalesce just enough to edge into frame? Can
					you see the invisible hand which tugs at the fraying threads of
					ancient power cycles?
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph full left-align`}>
					What will that interaction look like ten thousand peaceful iterations
					from now? I may only have one set of eyes, but I believe that each one
					of us can see the world through to change by collectively observing
					peace. What do you believe?
