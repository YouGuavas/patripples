				using found materials and holistic land remediation methods for the
				better part of this spring. This has been an incredibly rewarding and
				fruitful experience, from which I have drawn a great deal of personal

				crows; intrepid mink; and even a couple clever chickadees.

				It went well, and once he came to understand the scope of both the
				damage and the triage at play, his enthusiasm grew to rival my own.

				Each of these encounters has enriched and rewarded me in ways I struggle

				how to scale gratitude.
			</h2>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				Gratitude scales in a compounding way. As we share its seeds with those
				around us, they germinate and they bloom. We become pollinators of
				decency. I love the bees and the butterflies, but if you ask me, the
				world can always use more pollinators.
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				Have you ever seen a person come to life after life had given up on
				them?
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				Pollinating decency can do exactly that for the world, as well as for
				the unseen around us. After each of those seeds of gratitude blooms into
				a sapling, it sprouts into a tree - a spring of new life, and a peaceful
				place into which the old may fade.

				how to bear witness.
			</h2>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				If you have ever witnessed a forgotten soul spring to light from a dark
				space, then you have experienced the sort of gratitude that I have
				experienced on this journey.
			</p>

			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				Wherever it is that we each spring from, we are all part of the same
				system. Consciousness is vast and interconnected. Everything which
				surrounds us - from the birds, to the trees, and the mycelia and spores
				which flow between - represents <em>and</em> records a facet of reality.
				Each of us represents an expression of that vast network.
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				To witness the expression of another is to give them power. Whether that
				power comes through confidence, or through the knowledge of one&apos;s
				ability to get under the skin of another is not always certain. Consider
				the strength you felt the last time you showed one of your pursuits to a
				friend or mentor, and received praise - or something as simple as an
				awestruck smile. Also consider interactions where you have felt that
				someone was taking an action with the intent of getting a rise out of
				you.
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				In my mind, the best way to combat the latter is to embody the former.
				This world needs more witnesses to good deeds, and more good witnesses
				to all deeds. It can be nerve-wracking to begin a movement, certainly.
				Often just as difficult is to be the first to sign onto the vision of
				another.

				how to echo sovereign.
			</h2>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				Did you know that you can just do things? We don&apos;t have to wait for
				circumstances to get &quot;too bad.&quot; We can make a
				temporally-echoing difference <em>now</em>.
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				Every single action one takes toward healing - whether that be the
				healing of oneself, of one&apos;s world, or of some unnatural swamp -
				creates a ripple; an echo. This is true with or without witnesses. I am
				fortunate enough to have had a friend join me out of curiosity, but it
				took over a month of solo trekking (and talking about it) for that to
				come to bear.
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				Be your own witness. If you see an angle to improving the world around
				you, go out and live that. If your truth is true, witnesses will find
				their way to you.
