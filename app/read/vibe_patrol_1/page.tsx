				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					The following is an anecdote from a past life. I do not recall the
					exact date, as I was, myself, just beginning a return to consciousness
					from an extended period of self-inflicted, alcohol-induced oblivion.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					I know that policework is difficult. I won&apos;t pretend to be a
					professional. I only managed this by accident. Once. Everybody gets
					one.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					It was the early goin&apos; of the second comin&apos; of the
					roarin&apos; twenties. I was cosplayin&apos; a whiskey-sippin&apos;,
					smoke-rollin&apos; detective, down on his luck. Everywhere I walked, I
					imagined that the world quaked beneath my... Puma Legacy Dark Modes.

					How to Find a Dragon.
				</h2>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					I don&apos;t know the guy&apos;s intentions. I don&apos;t think he was
					malicious. I think he somehow thought that I was an opp.
				</p>{' '}
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					I can&apos;t say I blame him. In a way, I was doing what some cop
					should have been doing.
				</p>{' '}
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					At the time, I was close with a long-lost friend of mine, who
					struggles with her mother. As a result of this - probably at tension
					with her obvious desire to be close to <em>some</em> mother who values
					her, and some father who does the same - plus a nasty bump to the head
					when she was a kid - or some other calculus involving{' '}

					, she experiences Borderline Personality Disorder.
				</p>{' '}
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					She still struggles with bitter liquids, though when I met her, they
					still bit her worse. It wasn&apos;t only fluid courage - the crystals
					which lined her purse have led a lode of brilliant nodes to an early
					hearse.
				</p>{' '}
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					She got upset with me one night for coming to her rescue, at her
					request. In that interaction, I failed my friend and let her short
					fuse get the best of me. She walked into the night, distraught, having
					threatened to call the cops on me for her boyfriend&apos;s
					misinterpretation of &quot;benevolence&quot; (read: violence, enacted
					by someone meant to be a benefactor) if I followed behind. So I did
					not.
				</p>{' '}
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					I did make note of her direction, and layered in past stories&apos;
					connections - however hazy these wavy recollections may be. Something
					called out and told me that we&apos;d cross paths again.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					I would later discover that she had dropped her phone before slamming
					my dad&apos;s Prius door on me.

					Early the next morning, I set out on foot to earn my own redemption.
				</p>{' '}
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					I first braved the Dragon&apos;s Den - her mother&apos;s
					husband&apos;s well-built abode, wherein are contained absolutely no
					flaws, whatsoever. Despite the utter Perfection I witnessed within
					that home, I received no insights into the possible whereabouts of my
					friend from her mother - only reassurances that it was &apos;not your
					responsibility, but good luck.&apos;

				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>

					How to smell like a hawk.

				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					By that point, the jig was up. I could smell his chemical energy from
					half a block away, and just as well - I could tell by the way he was
					welding. There were a ton of juxtapositions of high hopes and
					underdelivered dreams, which seemed to me to scream, strewn throughout
					his boldly-displayed hopescape.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					Right. So, we had acknowledged each other. Psychically, speculatively.
				</p>{' '}
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					Next, I waved to him with my empty right hand. At the time, I was
					experimenting with tonal authority, and I think I spooked him a
					little.
				</p>{' '}
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					We discussed the dropped phone dynamic, and he asked some reasonable
					questions about me and what I had told him. I mentioned during
					introductions my friend&apos;s storming off, and he drew from there a
					logical enough inference - that if this woman had forced herself out
					of my vehicle, I must have been behaving poorly toward her.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					In my open explanation, I described the personality disorder with
					which she has been diagnosed, and I alluded to knowledge about the
					local use of &quot;some substance.&quot; I made it clear that I was
					there for my friend, a woman of whose presence he would have been
					aware. We find out later that he and the hospitable older man with
					whom my friend had sought refuge were crystal-crossed lovers in a past
					life.

				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					Long story short, we open with a small, wiry man - who <em>really</em>{' '}
					enjoys welding, &quot;accidentally&quot; pulling a gun out from
					beneath the front seat of his truck. I was looking about haplessly,
					totally relaxed in my musculature. Whatever his intentions as he
					approached the truck, our exchange went about as follows:
				</p>{' '}
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					&quot;Don&apos;t worry, this isn&apos;t for you.&quot;
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					&quot;Huh?&quot;
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					&quot;The gun.&quot;
				</p>{' '}
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					&quot;Huh?&quot;
				</p>{' '}
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					&quot;Oh, nevermind. I had a gun there, and I was just letting you
					know I wasn&apos;t pulling it on you.&quot;
				</p>{' '}
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					&quot;Oh, cool. I wasn&apos;t even thinking about that.&quot;

					height={333}
					width={425}
					src={it_me.src}
				/>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					We went on to spend the next two hours in his driveway unpacking both
					the trials and the highs he had experienced with his ex, who he -
					flawless in character, himself - had lovingly dubbed
					&quot;Satan,&quot; before inviting me into his home.
				</p>{' '}
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					Once inside, he allowed me to jot down a note for my friend using his
					stationery. How kind.
				</p>{' '}
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					From there, he told me about his wolfdogs. I think he maybe was a
					furry, judging by the wolf plushy in the far corner of his living
					room, and other inferences about his proclivites. Interesting guy. No
					judgement.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
					There is only so much thread one can untangle at once. He lamented the
