				<h3 className={`lowercase thin spaced left`}>An idea as a plant.</h3>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block`}>
					When we tend to one and feed its tension, it tends to bloom with great
					intention. When we leave its fruit and flower on the vine to linger,
					it tends not to wait, rather to wilt and wither - or ferment like sour
					vinegar. Sometimes an idea takes root in the heart, and sometimes in
					the mind. Often, it only blooms in time. If an idea requires time, and
					yet not to be left to linger, then we may come to ask ourselves:
					&quot;How can I fan at the flames which surround me not so much as to
					snuff my own lights out, only just enough to stretch the seeds of my
					insights out of their own stiff shells?&quot;
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block`}>
					A plant is only as healthy as its garden. This means that, beyond its
					own direct self interest, a plant benefits from developing strong
					roots - strong roots make for strong gardens, after all. How can this
					flower - this idea do a thing like this? It is a flower, after all,
					and flowers are not known for their agency. A plant strengthens its
					roots through patience, symbiosis, and biodiversity.
				</p>
				<h3 className={`lowercase thin spaced left`}>seeding a thought.</h3>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block`}>
					If an idea is a plant, then it must have sprouted from a seed. From
					where did that seed spring? Was it born in the belly, between breaths
					- or did it blink itself into life like a bulb between our eyes?
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block`}>
					I view each of us as embodying both a gardener and a pollinator of
					thought - a worldwide hive full of bees wishing to be their own
					keepers.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block`}>
					When we view the world in this way, it is easy to envision how an idea
					might first self-pollinate through some social interaction - picture a
					dandelion dancing in the wind, while from its head sips a
					dander-backed dancer: a nectar-drunk bumblebee, ready to buzz off to
					the next bulb, where it will drink more, dance more, and - more
					importantly - exchange plant matter.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block`}>
					When a bird or a bee does this, it is called pollination - when we do
					this, it is called conversation and collaboration.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block`}>
					Whenever we share an idea, or have one shared with us, we are engaging
					in a symbiotic resource exchange of the mind. As with the bee, who
					gets to buzz and vibe its way to solid status in the hive - or with
					the bird who exchanges seed for seeds - we are giving and receiving
					raw data, processed through a specially-wired natural supercomputer
					which has been specialized over millennia to engage in just this sort
					of exchange. We really are an incredible species - and part of an even
					more incredible ecosystem - when we&apos;re cooperating with one
					another.
				</p>
				<h3 className={`lowercase thin spaced left`}>
					A thinker as a gardener.
				</h3>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block`}>
					If an idea is a flowering plant whose roots stem from seeds, then the
					thinker of the thought is a gardener. In order for any idea to have
					reached bloom: it first needed to be a seed, then someone had to buy
					it a bit of time, and give it some attention to boot. Only then could
					this seed - whose weeds needed weeding (
					<Link className="no-deco" href="./glossary/axonal_pruning">
						axonal pruning
					</Link>
					), whose time stood at tension - even think to become a thought.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block`}>
					A garden is only as good as its gardener. If the gardener never waters
					their garden, nor prunes any weeds, they won&apos;t have much of a
					garden. Wild tangles have their place, as does a sandy space, but it
					must not bog down the garden.
				</p>
				<p className={`paragraph width-full block`}>
					This is my first post, and I&apos;m making it as a promise to
					self-seed going forward. My aim with patripples is to create and share
					a mind garden. Each of us are pollinators and gardeners of ideas -
					cultivators of thought. Together, I believe we can foster a collective
					mind garden whose flowers bloom with such natural force that we are
					forced to reckon with ourselves - peacefully - and then spring forth
					smarter, wiser, and more collaborative than ever before.
