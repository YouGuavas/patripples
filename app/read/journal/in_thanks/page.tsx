				How to be feared.
			</h2>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				To have spent a life - or a third of one - surrounded by people who
				wanted to see you be your smallest self is a punishment which none
				should ever have to endure endure. Certainly not you.
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>But you did.</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				And now you help people.
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				Not for recognition, or clout, or anything else. You do it because you
				have been there. You have been a warrior when you wished only to be a
				doctor. You have been a savior when you needed saving.
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				You have been the one with bold dreams and a big heart - giving until
				there is nothing left to give, and still giving more from your empty
				well.
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				Whoever took those dreams from you, know that they are not dead. A dream
				cannot die. They only enter stasis - to be passed along, transformed and
				changed by those who follow the trail you are forging.
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				Many will fear this when they see it in you.
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				They will fear the lion and the lamb alike. They will fear the lamb for
				refusing to die, despite death. For refusing to succumb, even in the
				face of that thing to which we must all one day yield - and for the
				bravery in which that refusal seats itself in pride.
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				They will fear the lion for its great teeth and mighty appetite.
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				This fear does not make the lion less noble, nor the lamb less brave.
			</p>

				Have you ever had to wear the mask of the lion in order to shepherd your
				sheep?
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				Then you know what it means to be the lamb.
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				Envision the lamb - your best-meaning self - wandering around, grazing
				in a field. Each step our lamb takes is done with the shaky-legged
				trepidation of a newborn. Since a lamb is a little like a kid, can you
				envision our cautious lamb losing track of its position within the field
				- focused on the great, green dangers which lie underhoof?
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				By the time the lamb has finished grazing on and investigating the
				complex intentions of grass, it may find itself on the edge - at the
				border between a grassy knoll and something else.

				How to grow proud.
			</h2>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				The lamb, finally reaching the end of the grass, decides to raise its
				head. Looking around, it sees no more of that treacherous grass which
				dared to tickle its hooves.
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				At first, a lion may be offended that some small thing has strolled
				right up, so bold - and so stupid. It looks like a nice snack.
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				How dare that thing step foot in <em>my</em> home? I am a lion! I am
				mighty! All things fear -
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>- BAAAAA!</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>*Roa-</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>- BAAAAA!</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				A lion does not tolerate interruptions - certainly not of this sort.
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				Still, something about this situation prompts curiosity in the lion.
				Meals do not typically walk up to lions. Generally, there is some chase
				- we&apos;ve all seen nature documentaries.

			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>

			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				The lion eats the lamb, we all get a little sad. Life goe-
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>- BAAAAA!</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				Why is that lamb still there? Why is it doing that at me? Doesn&apos;t
				it see the lion standing right behind it?
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				Nevermind. Now <em>I&apos;m</em> curious. And I&apos;m not lion. This
				lamb does not give up. I wonder if it has seen a nature documentary.
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				What is it doing now? It seems to be walking <em>toward</em> the lion -
				it must have mistaken the mane for its mother&apos;s wool. Maybe.

				How to use teeth.
			</h2>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				Envision the lamb, back turned to the great lion behind, both gazing
				directly at you - lamb &quot;baaa&quot;-ing right at you. The lion? He
				is dead silent.
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>Lurking.</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				Baring his teeth - at <em>you</em>.
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				Prideful leaders have earned their status, no doubt, but not for their
				might and their violence. Rather, lions will have had to fight, and
				scrap and scratch and claw - as a species - from the bottom to the top,
				since the dawn of time.
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				We have all seen a nature documentary.
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				Any leader - or indeed, any being - who has climbed from the bottom to
				the top is inclined to recognize the same spirit within another being.
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				This lamb has no desire to climb - it is a sheep, not a goat. Still, the
				spirit of the king sings within - literally or mythically. This lamb
				could have turned and run. Instead, through the naivety of youth, it has
				done the bravest thing many could imagine - turned its back to a lion.
				Whether it did so on faith - or on the whims of a kid - hardly matters.
				What does matter is that you are now facing down a lion who is baring
				his teeth. Again, not at the lamb, but at <em>you</em>.

				How to be you.
			</h2>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				Being you sounds difficult.
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				You keep giving and giving and giving, and you receive little in return
				except a lion&apos;s snarling.
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				But that&apos;s why you do it. How many have survived the lion&apos;s
				jaws - its paws? How many have seen a lamb wander up to a lion in the
				first place?
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				You continue to be you by seeing the awe even in the insurmountable. You
				may be toe to toe with a deadly lion and a lamb with a death wish, but
				your spirit is made of stardust, and your body contains the same
				materials which compose granite.
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				Keep being solid, and the world will build itself around you. Lions do
				not fear rocks, and nor do lambs confound them.
			</p>
			<p className={`paragraph width-full block left-align`}>
				You are built of bedrock.
